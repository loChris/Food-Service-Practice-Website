Practice Project

Omnifood is a nonfunctional website that in theory provides a food delivery, subsciption-Sbased service where your meal is delivered right to your door.

This website was made while participating in an online course made by Jonas Schmedtmann.

Code includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript (JQUERY).
